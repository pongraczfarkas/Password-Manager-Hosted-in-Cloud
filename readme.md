# Vulnerability Assessment Lab
## Description

This guide explains how I set up a self-hosted password manager environment using Passbolt on AWS. The purpose of this project was to gain experience with secure password management, learning how to implement, configure, and maintain a robust system for safeguarding sensitive data. This project highlights key steps in deploying and managing a secure, cloud-based application. Using Passbolt hosted on AWS, I will ensure secure storage of complex passwords.

## Environments used

- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Ubuntu 24.04
